What is "Collector"?
====================

Collector is the component in charge of subscribing to the channel where stats and events are published. Message storing policies are determined by matching type or a regexp defined in the config file.

You can configure:

  - Your stats types, adding operations: counter, median, percentile 95, min, max, etc.

  - Retention:

    - History time (N days)

    - Sample (N seconds or N minutes or N hours)


Also "Collector" offers a JSON API to query stored stats (used by WebUIStats component).


Requirements
============

- PHP 5.3.2 and up with pcntl extension installed.
- RabbitMQ or ZMQ.
- MongoDB

Configuration
=============

All configuration is done using a YAML file.

Config file is structured in 4 sections:

- storage:
	- class name in charge of process and store messages.

- output:
	- storage name configured to get data to the JSON API.

- channel:
	- class name that subscribe to the channel to get messages.

- stats:
	- stat types definition. Assign some operations and retention time.
	- config can be defined by type or by a regexp

See config file for more details and examples.


Extra notes

Use of ZMQ is discontinued because a memory leak using ZMQ with OpenPGM PUB/SUB.
